Examples on some of the electronics needed for this project will be added here. 
All of the schematics are not available in electronic form. Brief descriptions:

example_noisegen:
	Kicad project for 3+1  output reference noise generator. Drives 3 couplers, 
	one directionally coupled for reference dongle. Separate power connectors
	for the MMIC amplifier chain and Zener diode. Optional enable signal for
	diode current (bypassed in prototype build). Our design switches the noise
	by disabling the operating voltage on the MMIC amps.

	The output connectors should be changed to MCX, currently they are MMCX.

clock_generator:
	The clock generator (no complete schematic for this currently), is a buffered 
	Pierce-type oscillator. Uses 74HC04 and 74HC14 (Schmidt trigger) inverters. See
	example_clock. The Schmidt trigger (for reducing noise) is not strictly necessary 
	and could be replaced by 74HC04, or alternatively a single Schmidt trigger followed 
	by 74HC04 buffers.


coupler module for 7 receivers:
	The reference noise is distributed to the receivers via directional coupling.
	Check the .jpg for the idea: here the top PCB is a D-Link USB hub.
	
	Published with permission from Tejeez: coupler.zip & adapter.zip contain the 
	plotted gerber files for a 7-element coupler PCB assembly. You will also need 
	a suitable 7-port HUB, some SMD caps & resistors, inductor and MCX & angled 
	BNC connectors. Also, pin header connectors between adapter and coupler boards. 
	A crude BOM and component values will likely be added when schedule permits...
	 
	To improve robustness, RF-switch ICs could be used instead of directional coupling 
	to perform this function. A strong signal from the antennas on the frequency of 
	interest might interfere with the synchronization in the current coupling approach.
